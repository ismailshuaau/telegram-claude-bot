# Agent Awareness Integration

## üéâ What's New

Your Telegram bot now has **intelligent agent awareness**! It can leverage the ChefVision agent system to provide smarter, more informed responses.

**Date Added**: 2025-10-26

---

## What This Does

### Before Agent Awareness

```
You: "deploy to staging"
Bot: [Deploys using standard approach]
```

### After Agent Awareness

```
You: "deploy to staging"
Bot: "Let me check the aws-infrastructure-specialist learnings first...

     I see that staging deployments need 1024MB memory allocation
     due to database migration overhead, based on past experiences.

     I'll use the recommended settings...

     [Deploys with learned optimizations]

     ‚úÖ Deployed successfully! Also updating agent context with this deployment."
```

---

## How It Works

When you send a message to the Telegram bot, it now:

1. **Checks for agent system** in your PROJECT_DIR
2. **Enhances your message** with agent context information
3. **Claude reads agent learnings** before acting
4. **Applies discovered patterns** from past work
5. **Updates agent context** after significant actions

**It's completely transparent - just chat naturally!**

---

## Agent System Files

The bot can access these intelligent agent features:

### Agent Learnings (`/.claude/agents/learnings/`)

Documented solutions and patterns discovered through real use:

- `aws-infrastructure-specialist.md` - Deployment patterns, infrastructure solutions
- `database-specialist.md` - Schema patterns, migration strategies
- `test-automation-specialist.md` - Testing patterns, coverage strategies

**Example**:
```markdown
### 2025-10-26: ECS Memory Limits
**Problem**: Staging deployments fail with OOM during migrations
**Solution**: Use 1024MB instead of 512MB for tasks
**Impact**: Stable deployments, no more crashes
```

### Agent Context (`/.claude/agents/context/`)

Recent actions and error resolutions:

- `<agent>_recent_actions.json` - Last 10 actions taken
- `<agent>_learned_patterns.json` - Recurring patterns
- `<agent>_error_resolutions.json` - How errors were solved

### Agent Handoffs (`/.claude/agents/shared/handoffs.json`)

Work delegated between agents:

```json
{
  "from_agent": "database-specialist",
  "to_agent": "test-automation-specialist",
  "context": {"models_modified": ["Meeting"]},
  "deliverables": {"required": ["Model tests"]}
}
```

### Agent Metrics (`/.claude/agents/metrics/`)

Performance tracking across agents.

---

## Setup

### 1. Set PROJECT_DIR

Point to the ChefVision project:

```bash
export PROJECT_DIR="/home/ubuntu/projects/chefvision-analytics-platform"
```

**Important**: This must point to the ChefVision project where the `.claude/agents/` directory exists!

### 2. Verify Setup

```bash
./verify-agent-awareness.sh
```

This checks:
- ‚úÖ PROJECT_DIR is set correctly
- ‚úÖ Agent system exists
- ‚úÖ Agent awareness code is installed
- ‚úÖ Agent learnings are available

### 3. Start the Bot

```bash
./start-local.sh
```

You should see:
```
üß† Agent system detected: /home/ubuntu/projects/chefvision-analytics-platform/.claude/agents
‚ú® Intelligent agent awareness ENABLED
```

---

## Testing

### Test 1: List Available Learnings

```
You: "what agent learnings are available?"
Bot: [Lists learning files in .claude/agents/learnings/]
```

### Test 2: Read Specific Learning

```
You: "what has aws-infrastructure-specialist learned about deployments?"
Bot: [Reads and summarizes aws-infrastructure-specialist.md]
```

### Test 3: Intelligent Deployment

```
You: "deploy to staging"
Bot: "Checking aws-infrastructure-specialist learnings...

     I see several important patterns:
     1. Use 1024MB memory for migrations
     2. CloudFront requires OAC before distribution
     ...

     Deploying with optimizations...
     ‚úÖ Done!"
```

### Test 4: Agent Context Update

```
You: "you just deployed - update the aws-infrastructure-specialist context"
Bot: "I'll add this deployment to recent_actions.json..."
     [Appends to context file]
     "Updated! ‚úÖ"
```

---

## Example Conversations

### Deployment with Agent Intelligence

```
You: "I need to deploy the new meetings API to staging"

Bot: "Let me check the agent learnings first...

     From aws-infrastructure-specialist learnings:
     - Staging needs 1024MB memory (migration overhead)
     - Always run health checks before marking as complete
     - Monitor for 5 mins after deployment

     From database-specialist learnings:
     - New meetings API has pending migration 0042
     - Migration adds deleted_at field (safe, fast)

     I'll deploy with these considerations...

     [Executes deployment]

     ‚úÖ Deployed successfully!
     - Health checks passed
     - Migration completed in 2.3s
     - Monitoring for errors...

     No errors in first 5 minutes. Deployment looks good! ‚ú®

     Updating agent context..."
```

### Bug Fix with Pattern Application

```
You: "users are reporting 403 errors on CloudFront"

Bot: "Checking aws-infrastructure-specialist error resolutions...

     Found it! This is error resolution #002:

     **S3 Access Denied (403)**
     Root Cause: OAC created after CloudFront distribution
     Solution:
     1. Create OAC first
     2. Note OAC ID
     3. Create distribution with OAC
     4. Update S3 bucket policy

     This has happened 2 times before, resolved in avg 20 minutes.

     Want me to fix it now using the documented solution?"

You: "yes please"

Bot: "Applying the learned solution...
     [Fixes CloudFront configuration]
     ‚úÖ Fixed! 403 errors should stop.

     Updating error resolutions with this occurrence..."
```

## How Claude Uses Agent Intelligence

### Pattern Recognition

Claude automatically:
- Checks relevant agent learnings before acting
- Applies discovered patterns from past work
- References error resolutions for known issues
- Updates context after significant actions

### Proactive Optimization

Instead of trial-and-error:
```
‚ùå Before: Deploy ‚Üí Fail ‚Üí Debug ‚Üí Fix ‚Üí Deploy ‚Üí Success
‚úÖ After: Read learnings ‚Üí Deploy with optimizations ‚Üí Success
```

### Knowledge Accumulation

As you use the bot:
1. Claude discovers new patterns
2. Documents solutions in learnings
3. Updates context with actions
4. Next time: Applies learned knowledge immediately

**The bot gets smarter over time!**

---

## Configuration

### Enable/Disable Agent Awareness

**Enabled by default** if agent system exists at `$PROJECT_DIR/.claude/agents/`

To disable:
- Set PROJECT_DIR to a directory without `.claude/agents/`
- Or remove the `_get_agent_aware_prompt` method from telegram_proxy.py

### Agent Awareness Behavior

The bot checks on **every message**:
1. Is agent system present? (`$PROJECT_DIR/.claude/agents/`)
2. If yes ‚Üí Enhance message with agent context
3. If no ‚Üí Send original message (standard mode)

**No configuration needed - it just works!**

---

## Benefits

### 1. Faster Problem Resolution

Use documented solutions instead of debugging from scratch:
- Known errors ‚Üí Instant solutions
- Deployment patterns ‚Üí Optimized deployments
- Testing strategies ‚Üí Better test coverage

### 2. Avoid Repeated Mistakes

Error resolutions prevent the same issue twice:
- OOM errors ‚Üí Memory limits documented
- CloudFront 403s ‚Üí Configuration order documented
- Migration failures ‚Üí Safe migration patterns documented

### 3. Continuous Improvement

Bot learns from every interaction:
- New patterns discovered ‚Üí Added to learnings
- Errors resolved ‚Üí Documented for next time
- Optimizations found ‚Üí Shared across work

### 4. Context Continuity

Recent actions inform future work:
- Last deployment ‚Üí Informs next deployment
- Recent errors ‚Üí Prevents recurrence
- Discovered patterns ‚Üí Applied automatically

---

## Troubleshooting

### Bot doesn't reference agent files

**Check**:
```bash
./verify-agent-awareness.sh
```

**Fix**:
```bash
export PROJECT_DIR="/home/ubuntu/projects/chefvision-analytics-platform"
./start-local.sh
```

### Agent system not detected

**Check path**:
```bash
ls $PROJECT_DIR/.claude/agents/
```

**Should see**:
```
context/  learnings/  metrics/  shared/
```

### Claude doesn't update agent context

**That's normal!** Claude updates when:
- You explicitly ask: "update the agent context"
- Significant discoveries are made
- Errors are resolved

You can always prompt: "add this to aws-infrastructure-specialist learnings"

---

## Advanced Usage

### Ask Claude to Create Learnings

```
You: "document what we just learned about CloudFront OAC in
     aws-infrastructure-specialist learnings"

Bot: [Adds to .claude/agents/learnings/aws-infrastructure-specialist.md]
     "Documented! ‚úÖ"
```

### Ask Claude to Check Handoffs

```
You: "are there any pending agent handoffs?"

Bot: [Reads .claude/agents/shared/handoffs.json]
     "Yes, 2 pending handoffs:
     1. database-specialist ‚Üí test-automation-specialist
        (Needs tests for Meeting model soft delete)
     ..."
```

### Ask Claude to Create Handoff

```
You: "create a handoff from aws-infrastructure-specialist to
     test-automation-specialist for smoke tests after deployment"

Bot: [Adds to handoffs.json]
     "Handoff created! ‚úÖ"
```
